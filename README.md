Readme (lib@home)
=================

A framework to develop `*@home` projects for distributed calculations.

Currently this project is in an very early state and the lib@home
library is not really usable for productive stuff.  But if you are
interested in it, we provide the following resources to check the
current progress of development

What is lib@home?
-----------------

The goal is to develop a software library that can be used for **large
(time intensive) calculations** which are possible to split into
separate `tasks`.  There will be exist a server-side implementation
for Linux, which is possible to configure as `reverse proxy` for
common HTTP server applications (such like `Apache`) for easy
integration into existing WWW server (hopefully without re-configuring
firewall stuff) and the possibility to separate the **lib@home-server
process** to a remote cloud-machine.  The lib@home-server process with
a SQL database (`MariaDB` and `PostgreSQL` planned) distributes the
tasks to the **lib@home-user-clients** (Windows and Linux
implementation) which solves the `task` if it is currently not busy
with optionally graphical output, such like a much **calculation
intensive screensaver**.  If the `task` is solved the `task-result`
will be sent to the server which `verifies` the task-result, and if it
is a really possible solution then it can be saved to the database and
used for later `tasks`.  So far, **one `task` can be interpreted as
one iteration** of the large calculation.

Additionally there is an **achievement system** planned.  Every client
is logged-in via a cryptographic challenge-response authentication
using `OpenSSL`, this mechanism makes it easy to register a new
user-client without an user-interaction.  So every user have a public
(by default anonymous) **user profile**, where are statistics
available and achieved successes are logged for other community
members.  It's also planned to provide some **global statistics**,
such like the progress of the large calculation problem and
**optionally to provide some results** of it.

**Common use-cases** may be to train AI algorithms.  As you can
imagine, the concept of this library does only work if the calculation
itself is useful for the general public, and that is the goal of
lib@home.  So, nowadays the **scientists in biology and public
healthy** are interested in which **DNA/RNA sequences** matching which
property of an organism/virus.  Categorizing properties depending on
DNA/RNA sequences is a very popular topic which could be solved with
very long calculating training algorithms of **Artificial Neural
Networks**, **Support Vector Machines**, etc.  Mining digital
currencies, such like Bitcoin, is not a goal of this library.

You can find an **example application**, called `Prime@home` in the
[lib@home repository on
GitHub](https://github.com/YouDirk/libathome/tree/master/src/project).
The `task` which will be distributed to the client here is just an
incrementing integer (for example `45`).  The client takes this number
and calculates the prime-factors of it (in this example `3 * 3 * 5 =
45`) and send these back as `task-result` (here `{3, 3, 5}`).  The
server `verifies` the task-result by multiplying these factors (`3 *
3 * 5` is really `45`).  If the verification succeeded, then the
server writes the relation to the SQL database (`id=45 -> {(45, 2, 3),
(45, 1, 5)}`).  Now the database can be queried to get fast the
prime-factors.

Make targets
------------

```make
all <default>: Compiles the current directory and all sub-directories
recompile:     Runs 'clean' followed by 'all'
clean:         Deletes temporary files / prepare for recompilation
               Useful on 'Header file not found' compilation errors
clean-all:     Deletes all files which are not under version control
clean-doc:     Deletes all files generated by 'doc'
debug:         Compiles 'all' and runs 'project' in debugger (GDB)
debug-emacs:   Run 'project' in debugger (GDB) with Emacs support
doc:           Create a Doxygen documentation of the current directory
doc-view:      Runs 'doc' and show the resulting documentation in Browser
run:           Make 'all' followed by running 'project'
run-leakcheck: Same as 'run', but execute 'project' in Valgrind
tags-all:      Make 'tags-ctags', 'tags-etags' and 'tags-ebrowse'
tags-ctags:    Runs 'ctags' indexer for TAB auto-completion
tags-ebrowse:  Runs 'ebrowse' indexer for TAB auto-completion in Emacs
tags-etags:    Runs 'etags' indexer for TAB auto-completion
```

Playing around with lib@home
----------------------------

### Debian (Linux)

The main development is done on **Linux**.  If you are using
**Debian** (or Ubuntu) you need to have installed at least `make`,
`g++` and `libc-dev`, these packages are part of Debian package
`build-essential`.  Also you need to install `git`.  If you are
finished and have cloned the repository to your local machine then run
`make` to check for other dependencies.

```shell
$> sudo apt-get install git build-essential
$> git clone https://github.com/YouDirk/libathome libathome
$> cd libathome
libathome$> make run
```

> **Hint:** To automatically check the `make`-targets which are
>           available on-the-fly using **TAB auto-completion**, it is
>           recommended to install the Debian package `$> apt-get
>           install bash-completion`.  After doing this, open a new
>           Bash shell, type `libathome$> make ` and use the TAB-key
>           twice to list the `make`-targets.

### MSYS2/MinGW (Windows)

If you are using Windows you need to install `MSYS2`
(https://www.msys2.org). After installation is finished, run a
MSYS2-shell and make the system up-to-date by running

```shell
$> pacman -Syu
```

Then install at least the following MSYS2/MinGW packages: `git`,
`make` and `g++`.  If you are finished and have cloned the repository
to your local machine then run `make` to check for other dependencies.


```shell
$> pacman -S msys/git msys/make mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
$> git clone https://github.com/YouDirk/libathome libathome
$> cd libathome
libathome$> make run
```

> **Hint:** To automatically check the `make`-targets which are
>           available on-the-fly using **TAB auto-completion**, it is
>           recommended to install the MSYS2 package `$> pacman -S
>           msys/bash-completion`.  After doing this, open a new Bash
>           shell, type `libathome$> make ` and use the TAB-key twice
>           to list the `make`-targets.
